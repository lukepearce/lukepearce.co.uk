Portfolio of Luke Pearce
=============

I have removed the core Statamic files from this repository but I thought it'd be helpful for people starting out to see how to structure a simple Statamic site. Will be adding a "Startup" repository in the coming weeks that I can hopefully build into a Yeoman generator.

I built this site with help from [Harry Roberts'](http://csswizardry.com/) brilliant [Inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/) CSS framework. All files are managed using [Statamic](http://statamic.com/) a flat-file 'database free' CMS. My code was written with [Atom](http://www.atom.io). I use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to run my build tasks and [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) to write my markdown. The code for this site is shared on [GitHub](http://github.com/lukepearce/lukepearce.co.uk).
