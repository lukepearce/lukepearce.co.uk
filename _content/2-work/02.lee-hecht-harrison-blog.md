Created whilst working at Happy Giraffe, 'Making Your Grass Greener' is the thought leadership blog of [Lee Hecht Harrison](http://www.lhh-uk.co.uk/), a talent mobility and career development organisation. The design allows complete focus on each article with navigation being lead through the related categories, articles and authors. Through the [CMS](http://statamic.com), the authors are able to build a bespoke layout comprised of different visual elements, including pullquotes and full width imagery.
