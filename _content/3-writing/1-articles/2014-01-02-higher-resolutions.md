title: Higher Resolutions
---
My aim to write 750 words a day is one of five resolutions for the coming year. I have set this one to try and get me writing down my thoughts as a way to let off a bit of ‘head stress’. I’ve read lots about the need for us as human beings to talk about things, even to ourselves as a way for our brains to process our thoughts.

I was influenced by Stef Lewandanski, the founder of the excellent Makeshift. He wrote a piece on the idea of setting ['Higher Resolutions'](http://link.com). These were things that you could hold yourself to each and every day of the year. Something quantitive that could be completed and help to try and change your character, a habit forming thing or maybe something to stop.

So here are my other four resolutions. I plan to stick to them quite rigidly but won’t get too upset if I flag every now and again.

1. **Learn a new word every day or learn the meaning of a word I already know.** This is going to try and help my vocabulary grow and hopefully in turn make my writing skills a little better. It is also to try and make my memory slightly better. I struggle on a daily basis to remember a lot of my thoughts if I don’t make a note of them in the moment. I’m hoping that by trying to remember a new word and its meaning each day I can improve my memory when it comes to other things too! My word of the day yesterday was ['disdainful'](http://link.com) and it means to hold in contempt.

2. **Don’t work through your lunch break.** I began to struggle with burnout towards the end of work before Christmas. Starting a new job made me want to impress and started to work on both office stuff and personal stuff through the evenings. This meant that for a lot of nights I was working right up until my head hit the pillow and found myself unable to sleep as my mind was still racing. It was a similar story in office hours too. There was a period of about three weeks where I was working through every lunch hour. I could notice a huge difference in my ability to work well in the afternoons to when I was going out and taking a break.

3. **Take a photo every day and publish online.** I’m awful at taking photographs. I’m even more terrible and publishing _anything_ online. This resolution I set to try and overcome both.

4. **Publish insight into a work process each week.** I want to start to give back to the community that has taught me so much over the past two years. I think I’m at a stage where some of the things I have learnt and picked up along the way will be helpful to those who are at a similar point that I was.

So there they are, my five 'Higher Resolutions' for the year.
