## Print is Dead is Dead.<br>An examination into the print industry and its changing face in the digital era.

### Opening foreward
> Sometimes I get sick of staring at a screen all day. My eyes tire and my head starts to ache. I look forward to detaching myself from the never-ending feed that is my twitter account and a day of constantly checking and replying to emails. For a couple of hours I can unplug and relax, take time out and get lost in a good book or soak up some inspiration from a great design pub- lication. Recently I have started to read print articles from start to finish giving them my undivided attention. Compare this to when I read on my laptop or mobile device that I use to multi- task, flicking back and forth between applications, always leaving things halfway through. Print then, serves me with a beginning, middle and end and it’s this focused time with print that I love. It’s the experience of turning each page over with great intrigue as to what’s to come. It’s the layouts that please my eye with their white space and invitation to explore the pages that follow. The feeling of holding something, a physical entity that can keep me company on a long journey and at the same time transport me to a different place. The methods and transport of print means it tends to be a wonderfully slow medium. In our modern world full of instantaneous everything its a welcome break to wait for once with eager anticipation.

### The transition
The way we consume and produce both written and visual con- tent is changing. For the past two hundred years, if you wanted to read the news you’d buy a paper. If you were interested in the fashion world you’d get a copy of Vogue. If you wanted to find out who the next big rock band were going to be you’d buy NME.

The printing methods used by these large companies were quick and produced tens of thousands of issues in a short space of time. The audiences were spread over a wide demo- graphic, the content published was closely scrutinised and edited over a period of time. You expected to find a high quality of journalism, opinion from creditable sources and photographs taken by paid professionals. Today is quite different.

I will explore this transition from a primarily print fo- cused industry to a digital leading era in publishing, looking at new design practices for the digital medium, new devices and the doors they open for creatives to take advantage of and then take a look at what the future may hold.

## Print

### Large publishers
recently we have seen more and more of the content from the large publishers be made available online, in a both cheaper and quicker to access form. This, coupled with rising print costs has led many publishers to re-examine their business. I begin by looking at examples of publishers both changing and failing to adapt to new approaches.
