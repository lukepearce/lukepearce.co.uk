I was recently asked to write a quick overview of our process for web projects at Happy Giraffe. I'm planning on writing a few follow up posts with more detail on some of these points.

###### Discovery
At the outset we will discuss your project requirements in as much detail as we can to enable us to produce the best possible outcome. We get an idea for the type of goals and functionality you may need your project to have.

###### Content development
We work to contrast a clear strategy for getting your message and vision to the end user. Developing a site map allows us to structure content on a page by page basis.

###### Information Architecture
Once we have a site map we architect the content concentrating on each page. It is at this stage we can look at the hierarchy of the content.

###### Interactive Wireframes
This architecture is then built up into interactive wireframes that ideally hold a first draft of copy and placeholder images. You will be able to see these wireframes in situ through a web link. This enables us to discuss how the layout of your content flows on different screen sizes and devices.  

###### Visual Style
The visual style of your site will be developed incrementally and can be reviewed and discussed at each stage. We start with the smallest elements such as colors, typography, form fields, buttons etc. We then start to build these components up into larger pieces of content such as Navigation bars, complete forms, sidebars, blog posts, related links etc. The next and final stage is to start adding these styled components to the interactive wireframes.

###### CMS integration
Once we have agreed on the visual style and the way it is laid out we can integrate the site with a Content Management System. This will enable you to add, edit and delete various sections of content on the site. The level of control and customisation will have been discussed throughout the content stages.

###### Testing
Our testing starts on day 1. At each and every stage we will test for usability, functionality and any compatibility issues. Fixing as we go along has proved to make the end of projects a little less stressful.
