the myth of originality
(notes in notebook)

Designers look for influences to trigger ideas. We teach to pass on what we know. How can an idea be completely original? If nobody borrowed there would be no progression. All ideas are derived from other places, products, ideas. Even if we may think our idea is completely original we have probably been subconsciously influenced by an event prior to putting pencil to paper.

Looking back to the past for inspiration is now easier than ever with the vast amount of knowledge at our fingertips.

David Carson my have thought his designs were completely unique. Yet he wouldn't have designed them the way he had if those before him hadn't laid down the rules for him to break.
