title: Rethinking the flight booking process
---
We recently got invited to pitch for some work with Flybe. I had a look to see how we could design a better booking process for the user.

### Two halves
I did quite a bit of research involving trying to book flights with many of the popular airlines. Although they all differed there still seemed to be one major problem for people who just wanted to check a flights price quickly, with the aim to shop around for the best price — personal details. We discussed why the airlines would request these details before giving you a final flight price and came to the conclusion it was most likely to capture as much data as possible to target advertisements and promotions in the future. I looked at how we could do this differently.

###### Quote stage
A simple "Quote" with the option to save your quote for a flight price. This will only require information on flight destination, times, passenger numbers and any extras that could be added on to the flight price. This limits the amount of information needed to be inputted by the customer to reach a point that they are given a price.

###### Confirmation stage
This half would then be where the customers details are taken and any holiday extras are added. This would take place only when the customer is going to take payment through to the final stage of payment.

### Quick Book/Next flight
What if a customer doesn't know where they want to go and only know their departure location and dates they have free? Why not build a quick flight finder than returns possible flight destinations at great prices? These can then be used to build bigger orders of accommodation, car rental and any other extras that the airline partner with.

### Build considerations
- I want to feel like this is a simple and delightful task.
- I don’t want to have to fill in more information than is required.
- I ideally don’t want to touch my mouse too many times to navigate the forms.
- I want the information that matters to me most

### Prototype

I built a very quick, basic, prototype of the booking process for the two routes mentioned above. I presented this to members of the flybe development and marketing teams, talking through the process and challenging them to think differently about the way people booked flights with them.

The prototype focuses on the stages after you've selected your flight departure and arrival locations. You can [try it out](http://flybe.lukepearce.co.uk) if you're interested.
