title: Dissertation Notes
---
I've got to decide on a dissertation topic before Christmas. Here are some of my initial notes and thoughts on what I'd like to write 5,000 words on.

### Quotes
> “Hold on, let me look that up. I just happen to have to sum of human knowledge in my pocket.”

> I also find myself being more interested in hardware. I’m fascinated by the act of reading and where books might go next. What lives on with the things that we write and how do we get it into people’s hands in a meaningful way? The way we’re doing it now with iPads and Kindles doesn’t feel right. That’s not me lamenting for print books, but I think there should be a larger connection that we’re missing with words beneath glass.
<cite>Jason Santa Maria, The Great Discontent</cite>

> You get a lot of stuff you know won't commission in a million years. Printed material has to be pretty special for you to want to keep it. It only has value if it's lovely.
<citeMark Reddy, Head or Art, Bartle Bogle Hegarty</cite>

### Broad content
The deliverance of content is constantly changing and adapting. There are many reasons for these changes coming about. The advances in technology, the increasing cost of traditional print methods and the push towards a more affordable digital process. With an increase in technological advances with devices that allow content to be delivered has led to more content not even getting to print and instead delivered in a purely digital format. I want to look at how content is delivered and how we need to re-examine how we have adopted digital deliverance. I want to question why many have only directly transferred their printed content to digital and not really thought about how this transition changes the form of content and how it is interacted with.

> Magazine apps on the iPad shouldn’t be a quick translation of a print, but something that can animate and navigate differently, surprise, delight and celebrate all the things tablets can do that print can’t.
[Richard Spencer Powell, Creative Director of Monocle magazine](http://ideas-illustrated.tumblr.com/post/28758610186/an-idea-a-day-richard-spencer-powell-on-publishing)

I will look at certain products that have started to drive digital content such as the iPad and kindle.  

### Ultimate aim
Examine and question the conventions of how we design content for the digital.
Examine the transition of content from its physical form to the digital.

### Main objectives
To question whether we need to re-examine the design of content when transferred from print to digital.
Examine the rise of independent publications and how the print industry hasn't died but has changed. The big boys have left and moved to a purely digital sphere whereas there has been a huge rise in independent publications with a small print run. I will look at how these smaller printers and creating print with more meaning and care than before.


### Possible chapters

1. New form of content - design
2. Rise of an art form - craft
3. The web - content
4. Print will never die - conclusion

###### Designing for a new form of content
This chapter will begin by looking at old design practices within the print industry. I will explain how the form of the printed page governed the design. I will then question whether we should simply use these old design practices within our digital work or whether we should focus on developing new techniques and ways of solving design problems.

> Nor do today’s media companies – not fully, not yet. Look at how they’re using the web and new platforms such as the tablet. They’re still attempting to replicate legacy forms, content, business models, industrial structures, and control: Old wine in new casks. Newspapers, magazines, and books all remain recognizable as such online.
[Jeff Jarvis, Think Quartely Google](http://www.thinkwithgoogle.co.uk/quarterly/speed/not-so-fast-jeff-jarvis.html)

I will look at the form of digital devices, the technology they use and the new challenges we face as a result.

> Current products are still deeply rooted in the past, but new diverse platforms and interactions will emerge.
[Stephanie Rieger, Reset the web](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/bdconf-stephanie-rieger-presents-reset-the-web/)

I want to bring the new opportunities we have been presented with to the forefront of the design industry and challenge them to innovate and push our industry to new boundaries within the digital domain.

I want to look at how instead of merely duplicating our printed material to digital we need to re-define it. Physical and digital need to be seen as separate entities, with their own purposes. I want to look at cases where print or digital may be more appropriate and the pro's and con's each medium bring to the deliverance and impact of our content on the world.

###### Typography
This could be a sub chapter of 'new forms of content'. I would like to explore the changes to typography as technology has advanced. Typefaces that were used in the first printed books are very different to todays. I would like to focus on typography in the modern age. The latest technology advance in screen resolution with the introduction of higher than print ppi and what that means for screen typography.

###### The fall of the print industry, the rise of an art form
This chapter will focus on print. It will explore the history of the print industry from the first printed book to the beginning of 2008 when it was first stated that the print industry was 'dying'. I will then look at the rise of niche publications in the digital era.

###### What is the web?
This chapter will explore the history of the web. I will focus on the technologies of the web and its changing landscape. I will take a look at the various devices we are now using to access content on the web and what this means for the designer. A large part of this chapter will link with my studio work. I will explore the topic of responsive design and the fluid web.

I would like to explore the social impact of the web. What will happen when everyone in the world can connect? The web will become a tool for social change. The world of information in our hands.

I want to look at how the web as a site inside a browser will vanish and instead the web will blend into our everyday lives as an un-definable service.

> "the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it"
Mark Weiser (1991 chief scientist Xerox PARC)

> Technological revolutions have several interesting properties. First, we tend to overestimate the immediate impact and underestimate the long-term impact.Second, we tend to place the emphasis on the technologies themselves, when it is really the social impact and cultural change that will be most dramatic.
Don Norman, drop everything you're doing

###### The content itself
This chapter will explore the wide range of content being published whether it be online or in a physical form. I want to show people how the content we are printing is more considered and of a higher quality now that printing costs have risen.

> "However many channels you've got [ie in print or online], if you haven't got quality content, you're wasting your money."
Sara Cremer, MD at Redwood

I also want to shed light on the impact of self publishing to our industry and how it's let more people than ever before access this sea of content.

###### new opportunities with digital media/content
This chapter will explore the incredible power that digital gives to our content. It can be shared to a global audience within seconds. I think this "chapter" could go under a wider chapter topic.

###### Print will never die - reasons why.
This chapter will remind that print will always have its place alongside digital content. Neither could function to its full capacity without the other.

> "You don't need print for news any more," he says. "But for long, visual-driven stories, it can offer a business model and an immersive focused quality that digital cannot offer yet."

> It is only helpful to make the distinction if you can then emphasise and radicalise the inherent qualities and advantages of both media. I just don't get why people always see it in either/or dichotomies; it's more about the 'AND'.
Joerg Koch, Co-founder of 032c, a Berlin fashion magazine

> The amazing range of technological opportunities that can be used to support and interact with print are definitely a bonus, not a threat.
<cite>Munro Smith of Moshi Monsters'</cite>

I would like to include a personal account of why I will never give up on print. The following is taken from an article I wrote for a project last year on what print means to me.

> Sometimes I get sick of staring at a screen all day. My eyes tire and my head starts to ache. I look forward to detaching myself from the never ending feed that is my twitter account and a day of constantly checking and replying to emails. For a couple of hours a day I can unplug and relax, take time out and get lost in a good book or soak up some inspiration from a great design publication. Recently I have started to read print articles from start to finish giving print my undivided attention. Unlike when I read on a screen or mobile device, that is used to multitask, I tend to flick back and forth from application to application always leaving things halfway through. Print however, serves me with a beginning, middle and end and its this focused time with print that I love. The experience of turning each page over with great intrigue as to whats to come. Layouts that please my eye for white space and invite me to explore the pages content. The feeling of holding something, a physical entity that can keep me company on a journey and at the same time transport me to a different place. The methods and transport of print means it tends to be a wonderfully slow medium. In our modern world full of instantaneous everything its a welcome break to wait for once with eager anticipation.
Me, 2011
