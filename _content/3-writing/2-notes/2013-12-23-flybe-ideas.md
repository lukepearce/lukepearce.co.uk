title: Rethinking the flight booking process
---
#### Two halves to the booking process

###### Quote stage
A simple "Quote" with the option to save your quote for a flight price. This will only require information on flight destination, times, passenger numbers and any extras that could be added on to the **flight** price. This limits the amount of information needed to be inputted by the customer to reach a point that they are given a price.

Flight information packages are a barrier to entry. You are presented with three different prices and there isn’t any need to be shown this variety at this point. They are all the same flight and the same 'class'. The increase in price comes from extras.


###### Confirmation stage
This half would then be where the customers details are taken and any holiday extras are added. This would take place only when the customer is going to take payment through to the final stage of payment.


#### Quick Book/Next flight
What if a customer doesn't know where they want to go and only know their departure location and dates they have free? Why not build a quick flight finder than returns possible flight destinations at great prices? These can then be used to build bigger orders of accommodation, car rental and any other extras that the airline partner with.


#### Build considerations
- I want to feel like this is a simple and delightful task.
- I don’t want to have to fill in more information than is required.
- I ideally don’t want to touch my mouse too many times to navigate the forms.
- I want the information that matters to me most
