Hi, I'm Luke. I'm a digital designer and front-end developer, helping to take brands to digital platforms.

My interest in all areas of our industry, from the initial strategy of a new project to the server side technologies that make it a reality, enable me to bridge the gap between design and engineering, understanding how function and
aesthetic influence one another.

Off screen I enjoy getting out on my [bike](http://www.strava.com/athletes/lukepearce) or putting on my [running shoes](http://www.strava.com/athletes/lukepearce) to clear my head, going to the [cinema](/library/film) with friends or [reading](/library/books) design publications listening to new, and old [records](/library/records).

Keep up with what I'm up to over on <span class="strava">[Strava](http://www.strava.com/athletes/lukepearce)</span>, <span class="instagram">[Instagram](http://instagram.lukepearce.co.uk)</span>, <span class="twitter">[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/lucus_)</span> and [GitHub](http://github.com/lukepearce). If you'd like to know a bit more about my work download my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/giy89dtnij0epw3/luke-pearce-cv-for-web.pdf). You can also contact me via email at [hello@lukepearce.co.uk](mailto:hello@lukepearce.co.uk).

### Colophon
I built this site with help from [Harry Roberts'](http://csswizardry.com/) brilliant [Inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com/) CSS framework. All files are managed using [Statamic](http://statamic.com/) a flat-file 'database free' CMS. My code was written with [Atom](http://www.atom.io). I use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to run my build tasks and [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) to write my markdown. The code for this site can be viewed on [GitHub](http://github.com/lukepearce/lukepearce.co.uk).
